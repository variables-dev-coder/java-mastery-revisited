# Java Mastery Revisited ☕🚀
> Second-pass Java mastery focused on fundamentals, internal workings, and interview-level clarity — built through disciplined daily practice.

---

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository represents my **intentional re-learning of Core Java**, even after completing all topics up to **JVM Internals**.

The goal is **not re-learning for basics**, but:
- Strengthening fundamentals
- Eliminating blind spots
- Achieving interview-grade clarity
- Writing cleaner, more intentional Java code

This is a **mastery pass**, not a beginner journey.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Revisit Java concepts from **first principles**
- Focus on **why things work**, not just how
- Improve explanation ability for interviews
- Connect core Java concepts to real backend systems
- Maintain **daily GitHub discipline**

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

> “The first pass builds familiarity.  
> The second pass builds authority.”

- Slow, deliberate re-learning
- Deep focus on internals & edge cases
- Minimal but meaningful examples
- Clean code > quantity of code
- Every topic explainable to an interviewer

## 📚 What This Repo Focuses On

This repository revisits **all Core Java areas**, including:

- Java syntax & control flow (revisited deeply)
- OOP fundamentals with real design thinking
- Java Memory Model & object lifecycle
- Collections & their internal behavior
- Generics (variance, bounds, wildcards)
- Java 8+ functional programming (Streams, Lambdas, Optional)
- Concurrency & multithreading concepts
- JVM internals & performance basics

> The original implementations and full coverage live in my **primary Core Java repository**.  
> This repo is about **refinement and mastery**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- Java: JDK 8 → JDK 17
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

---

## 📅 Commitment

- Daily or near-daily updates
- Clear, meaningful commit messages
- Consistent progress over intensity
- Learning + application in parallel

---

## 🚀 How This Fits My Bigger Plan

- Strong Core Java foundation ✔
- API Specialist journey (parallel)
- Spring Boot & backend system design
- Interview preparation for backend Java roles

This repository acts as a **bridge between fundamentals and real-world backend engineering**.
